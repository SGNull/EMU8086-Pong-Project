# EMU8086-Pong-Project
This was a project created for the microprocessors class that I took. This is a very modifiable version of the game Pong made using a pixel graphics output. The DX register (when IP is in the MAINLOOP) is the score. The score is incremented each time the paddle makes contact with the ball.
The key values are at the top of the sourcecode, like the play area's dimensions, the ball's size and speed, as well as the paddle's size and speed. If the program is running on a faster machine than the emulator, these values can be adjusted to get a normal-sized game of Pong.
